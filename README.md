# MoviePitch

MoviePitch is an innovative web-based concept generator for movie pitches that harnesses the power of advanced AI technologies.
Utilizing OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo version for text generation and DALL-E for image generation, this application allows users to
input one-sentence movie concepts and generates captivating movie titles, synopses, posters, and even cast selections. This
platform features a setup section for concept input and an output section that showcases the generated content, including the
title, stars, and synopsis. By seamlessly integrating front-end technologies like Javascript and CSS, and cutting-edge AI
capabilities for content creation.
I created this project by following an excellent tutorial on Scrimba.
